# Summary: Basic and Specialized Visualization Tools
- Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know: 
- A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic, divided into segments, to illustrate numerical proportion.
- The process of creating a pie chart involves importing Matplotlib to represent a large set of data over a period of time.
- A box plot is a way of statistically representing given data distribution through five main dimensions.
- The five main dimensions are minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.
- You can create a box plot using Matplotlib.
- A scatter plot displays values pertaining to typically two variables against each other.
- The process of creating a scatter plot involves importing Matplotlib to visualize a large set of data.
- Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library that offers a flexible interface for creating various types of plots.
- Matplotlib’s Pyplot module offers a convenient way to create and customize plots quickly.
- Data Storytelling is the ‘art of storytelling’ that involves creating a narrative around the data.
- Data visualization is an important aspect of data storytelling and involves creating engaging visuals.
