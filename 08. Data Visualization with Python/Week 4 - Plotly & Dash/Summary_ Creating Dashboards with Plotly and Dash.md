# Summary: Creating Dashboards with Plotly and Dash
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know: 

- Dash is an Open-Source User Interface Python library for creating reactive, web-based applications.

- It is easy to build Graphical User Interfaces using Dash as it abstracts all technologies required to make the applications.

- There are two components of Dash: Core and HTML components.

- The dash_core_components describe higher-level interactive components generated with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through the React.js library.

- The dash_html_components library has a component for every HTML tag.

- A callback function is a python function that is automatically called by Dash whenever an input component's property changes.

- The @app.callback decorator decorates the callback function in order to tell Dash to call it whenever there is a change in the input component value.

- The callback function takes input and output components as parameters and performs operations to return the desired result for the output component.
